Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

Aangezien ik meestal de organisator ben als we met vrienden op citytrip gaan, ben ik eveneens graag een goede host voor mijn gasten.
Daarom sta ik altijd klaar met suggesties om jullie verblijf extra aangenaam te maken.
Ik woon al meer dan 10 jaar in dezelfde buurt als het appartement, wat betekent dat ik snel in de buurt ben in geval van een probleempje, maar ook dat ik de buurt heel goed ken en voldoende tips kan geven wat betreft bezienswaardigheden en restaurantjes. 
Het appartement is ruim en heeft een grote woonkamer met hoog plafond, wat ervoor zorgt dat het gezellig vertoeven is als je met een groep vrienden of met het gezin een weekend samen wilt doorbrengen.
Het interieur is nogal eclectisch qua stijl, vintage gemixt met design klassiekers. Vooral geen zwart/wit, maar kleurrijk, en ook zo ingericht dat het lijkt alsof iemand er echt woont, geen steriele hotelkamer. Ik ben een liefhebber van films, fotografie en kunst, en dit valt eveneens als je het appartement betreedt. Litho's van Karel Appel en Dali worden afgewisseld met foto's van Helmut Newton en Herb Ritts. 
Als ik zelf op citytrip ga, vind ik naast de huiselijkheid van het appartement dat ik huur, de locatie erg belangrijk. Daarom dat ik voor het appartement op Vleminckveld gekozen heb, het ligt recht in het midden van alle belangrijke attracties/buurten.
Je kunt deze allemaal te voet bezoeken, het bruisende Zuid, het historisch centrum, het shopping gedeeltje,... 
Het ligt dus enorm centraal en terrasjes en restaurantjes liggen zeer nabij, maar toch is de straat erg rustig, dus van nachtlawaai is geen sprake. 
Niet te vergeten is de supermarkt die zich in hetzelfde gebouw bevindt, super handig als je last minute nog iets nodig hebt.
Kortom ik heb geprobeerd alle elementen waar ikzelf belang aan hecht als ik op citytrip ga, te bundelen in het appartement dat ik verhuur in mijn thuishaven Antwerpen.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.
Enjoy your time in Antwerp, they say it's the city of diamonds. 
But for me it's the people who shine :)
Leave a note, a comment or better...a story before you leave. 
I love stories.

And the negative? Hm, even when I am cranky I can find something to smile about. Crankiness in itself is kind of funny.

Anyway, I'm a Dutch artist living in Antwerp, Belgium. Made a career switch after a few years working as a copywriter and brand strategist in Amsterdam. I'm a trained writer. From study (Dutch language and literature) to work (copywriter) till now in my art works: I'm always busy with words. 

I've landed in Antwerp in 2015. Over five years already. I LOVE this city. It's gentle and creative, it's got great museums and the best coffeebars. I will leave you a list of recommendations. 

But above all, living in a place like The Beguinage (Het Begijnhof) is the best blessing ever. City center AND quiet. It's a beautiful medieval place with a sacred garden where old trees speek to you - if you listen very carefully...

I hope to see you soon and welcome you here in my mystic abode.

My name is Thomas and I'm born and raised in Antwerp. I like cooking, cycling and skiing. I've recently rebuild this apartment and now I finally live here. 
Besides that, there is no secret place in Antwerp if we talk about restaurants, nice bars and fun spots to go out. I even have a list of restaurants per category which I'm happy to share with you when you stay in Antwerp
For work, I travel a lot to Amsterdam, Berlin and Copenhagen so always up for a drink there.

We are expats (a Canadian and a Belgian) who spent almost two decades living and working abroad.   Our favourite country was Namibia where we enjoyed 8 fabulous years, followed closely by Brooklyn, New York, and now we're retired in Malta (which we love!).  We are so fortunate and grateful for the many amazing adventures we've enjoyed and for all of the wonderful and loving friends we've made all over the world.  

If you want more information about us, you can check out the book I wrote in Namibia as a fund-raiser for a charity I support, just to prove to you I'm authentic.   Search for Danette Jaeb - Walk a Mile in My Shoes.  I also have a website that you can find if you search for me.

We are trying our hands at hosting our apartments if and when they are available.  Bear with us as we learn how to become Airbnb hosts.   We don't have many ratings yet since we have friends often staying at our studio but have decided to take a more serious stab at this now (September 2021).  

Thank you all.
